If the player selects the correct answer, the app shows a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it displays the next question.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, it tells the player that time's up and displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then show the next question.
If the player chooses the wrong answer, it tells the player they selected the wrong option and then displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.

On the final screen, it shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
